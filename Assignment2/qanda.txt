Question 1) 
	I/O devices are given locations in what would normally be thought of as memory space of the computer.
	That is, I/O devieces are mapped to small numbers of memory locations (known as "Memory Mapped").

Question 2)
	The difference isn't significant from the CPU point of view as it is still a piece of memory, but the
	developer should be careful using the byte-sized memory-mapped interface registerm and should only be 
	used as it is specified in the user manual.
	
Question 3)
	Polling is said to be inefficient because it's a waste of time in a system that is also atempting to
	perform other operations as polling will take up CPU cycles that can be used by other processes.

Question 4)
	To organize polling of two or more interfaces, we could have and array of subroutine handlers, or 
	we could have the interfaces in a loop, one after another.

Question 5)
	Polling is said to be inefficient power-wise because most of the time you are checking for a change that 
	has yet not occurred, meaning it's a waste of CPU cycles and energy.
