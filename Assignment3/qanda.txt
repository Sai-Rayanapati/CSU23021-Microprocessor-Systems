Question 1)
	Supervisor mode and System mode are similar in the sense that they are both priviliged, however, System mode
	has no register bank switch.

Question 2)
	When the multitasking is organized so that the scheduler is able to put a thread or a process into waiting
	without any problems and let other threads or processes to run, this is what is meant by preemptive.

Question 3)
	It is inadvisable to use a general-purpose operating system in a situation where real-time operation
	must be guaranteed as operating systems have soft deadlines which means operating systems can break a 
	deadline and the only penalty is on the performance.

Question 4)
	Using the MMU- Memory Management Unit we can specify how addresses generated by a user program are mapped
	to real addresses and allow user mode accesses to a certain range of of real addresses and thus prevent user 
	mode access from straying outside permitted set of real addresses which offers hardware-level memory
	protection.
	
Question 5)
	Interrupt driven I/O is more energy efficient as it waits for the interrupt to occur to execute any
	operations, whereas polling constatnly executes the operations until a change occurs. This means that
	the difference in efficency is whatever the cost of polling is, as the cost of interrupt driven I/O is
	0.
