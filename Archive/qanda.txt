Question 1)
	-The subroutine must utilize the limited amount of registers and memory in a efficent manner and make sure 
	 that they are not being overused. On top of this, we need to save the contents of registers before 
	 we use them in the subroutine, we should also only define safe memory.

Question 2)
	-My subroutine pushes any registers that are used in the subroutine onto the stack (which is cheap) and then
	 pops them back off to save their previous contents, and it also uses a small amount of registers. 

Question 3)
	-I would check my subroutine using normal values but also large values that may create a "deep recursion".

Question 4)
	-Since 64-bit values can in reality hold numbers in the billions and even more, multiplying them using
	 addition would result in trillions of operations which would be very inefficent.

Question 5)
	-If there was a very deep recursion then the result might not fit into 64-bits which would give and 
	 inaccurate result, this will also fill up the stack which has limited memory.
